Find out API stats..... maybe updated once an hour or less... dunno, but I must have used some resources from somewhere today. I did about 20 requests I think. Count them..
    - 95,000 tokens in total.  Cost estimate: $0.25
    - Is that token limit per Month ? nope lol. Tokens Per Minute. Calm down.
    - looks like 11 questions I asked for project-b68cd74. That's pretty efficient coding.
    - Probably a few more for project-3402007.md because I was being a bit more lax. but still. did 2 big projects in a day. Don't ever really need more than that???

# Summary of what we need to work on regarding `target zones` :


# Find cases where high/low wicks are significatly different than sticky zones
This is the real point of it after all. This should be real reversal areas
Maybe there is truck in contrasting sticky zones with reversal zones

# Bugs
Any left?



# Summary of plots stuff
Left with 'null window' hanging around because an egui_plot must have an 'over hover label' - no way to turn it off it seems rn


# B key to select background bars
Much too manual job at the moment
Should be tied to which zones we are currently viewing
But if we do that, can't view all zones on same map. Not good.
"B" key currently to toggel round background plot type. See if reverals anything, particularly with reversal zones.

# Overlapping zones
what to do about them
how to turn each type of zone on and off in legend
Can legend group bars of same type?
That would be great I think
Think it is connected with zone name though or something?
maybe an id thing? Not sure.... it did used to work like that
# What does it mean if live price is in both:
Active Resistance (wick), and
Active Support (wick)
at same time. Just overlapping zones?


# Eventually add candlesticks
Q. why don't background bars appear in the legend at all?
Want one option in legend if possible.
omg. but how can we drawn candles with interrupted price ranges? With interrupted candles I guess, lol.



## Sticky zone price target
Shoud price target be center rather than nearest edge of sticky zone ? (seems more natural than aiming for edge of structure, right?)
That's journey stuff I think, though, don't want let Gemimi loose on that yet, though, lol
