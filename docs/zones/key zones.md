Find out API stats..... maybe updated once an hour or less... dunno, but I must have used some resources from somewhere today. I did about 20 requests I think. Count them..
    - 95,000 tokens in total.  Cost estimate: $0.25
    - Is that token limit per Month ? nope lol. Tokens Per Minute. Calm down.
    - looks like 11 questions I asked for project-b68cd74. That's pretty efficient coding.
    - Probably a few more for project-3402007.md because I was being a bit more lax. but still. did 2 big projects in a day. Don't ever really need more than that???

# Summary of what we need to work on regarding `target zones` :


# Add candlesticks
But too scared to do with Gemini 3 Preview (Remote edition) - much too fucking painful.

# 0.35
See when 0.35 version is due out and what features it will offer. Might help guide decision making
Appears like quite a big API change (sigh)

## (Journey stuff) Sticky zone price target
Shoud price target be center rather than nearest edge of sticky zone ? (seems more natural than aiming for edge of structure, right?)
That's journey stuff I think, though, don't want let Gemimi loose on that yet, though, lol

# Target zone should be represented with a circle (the sniper target zone)
Cooolllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# WebGL isn't supported in WASM Version
What is that all about? Has it stopped running for some reason?

# On the price scale, how to ensure we get a price drawn at start of axis/
Definitely need it to see start of price range.
And for prices everywhere. Come up with a function or use a crate that prints fp more intelligently.
So $283218.31, $1300.3231, $0.0000032 i.e total number of digits, something like that?
